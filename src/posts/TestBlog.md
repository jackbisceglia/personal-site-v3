### __Welcome to my blog. I'm not sure what I'll be using this for, but here are some ideas:__
___
- Updates on projects I'm working on
- Programming tidbits
    - Python/JavaScript/React/more
- Learning New Technologies
    - Mostly web stuff
- Whatever I'm feeling like


### __For now I guess I'll talk about the tech I used to make this website & blog__
___

__Tech Stack__:
- Svelte -> Front-End component framework for JS -> __[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)__
- Sapper -> SSG and SSR framework for Svelte (*perfect for something like a blog*
) ->  __[Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/)__
- Marked -> JavaScript package to parse and compile Markdown and HTML -> __[Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)__

I plan on *maybe* making another blog post about my experience with Svelte and Sapper thus far, but for now I guess I can list some **pros** *and* **cons** from using it for this website:

__Pros__:
- Official Sapper template is super easy to use and understand
- Svelte makes development incredibly quick and seamless -> Easy setup, and very intuitive component model
- Markdown parsing was relatively easy with the tools I found
- CSS animations are incredibly easy with Svelte's built in **transition** library

__Cons__:
- Probably pretty overkill to use a framework like Svelte for a personal site and blog. This could be done with a more SSG focused technology just as easily, I'd assume
- As far as I can tell, Sapper is on its way out with the Svelte team's focus on SvelteKit -> [Future of Sapper/SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit)
- Sapper community isn't as large as something like React or Angular, however I would say that Svelte has *a lot* of built in functionality

Overall, pretty fun and easy development experience. I recommend using Svelte if you're too lazy to set up an entire React project. Svelte set up is quite minimal, and development is incredibly intuitive, *despite the fact that the jsx model is just better than any templating langauge*
